## 💡 Project Vision & Core Idea

In an era of information overload, the true sentiment driving market movements can be elusive. **FinPulse AI** aims to cut through the noise by:

* **Aggregating Diverse Data:** Sourcing data from financial news (e.g., Bloomberg, Reuters snippets), social media (e.g., X/Twitter, StockTwits), forums (e.g., WallStreetBets), and official economic releases.
* **Sophisticated Sentiment Analysis:** Moving beyond simple positive/negative scoring to understand nuanced emotions, sarcasm, and context specific to financial jargon.
* **Identifying Trends & Anomalies:** Detecting shifts in market sentiment, emerging economic concerns, or company-specific buzz before they become mainstream.
* **Providing Actionable Insights:** Translating raw sentiment scores into meaningful indicators for risk assessment, opportunity identification, and economic forecasting.

---

## 🌟 Key Features

* **Real-time Sentiment Tracking:** Monitors sentiment fluctuations for specific stocks, sectors, or economic indicators as they happen.
* **Multi-Source Aggregation:** Gathers data from a configurable list of financial news outlets, social platforms, and economic data providers.
* **Advanced NLP Models:** Utilizes state-of-the-art transformer-based models (e.g., FinBERT, BERT, RoBERTa) fine-tuned for financial text.
* **Aspect-Based Sentiment Analysis:** Identifies sentiment towards specific aspects of a company or economic event (e.g., "earnings," "inflation," "product launch").
* **Correlation with Market Data:** (Future Goal) Analyzes the relationship between sentiment shifts and subsequent market movements (price, volume).
* **Customizable Dashboards:** (Conceptual) Visualizes sentiment trends, hotspots, and comparative analysis through an intuitive interface.
* **API for Integration:** (Planned) Allows developers to integrate sentiment data into their own trading bots, research platforms, or financial models.

## 🔬 Methodology Deep Dive

**FinPulse AI** employs a multi-stage pipeline:

1.  **Data Collection:** Automated scripts fetch textual data from selected financial news sites (e.g., Reuters, MarketWatch), social media (X/Twitter focusing on cashtags like $AAPL, $TSLA), and economic forums.
2.  **Preprocessing:**
    * Text cleaning (removing HTML, special characters, URLs).
    * Tokenization, lemmatization/stemming.
    * Stop-word removal (using a custom financial stop-word list).
    * Handling financial jargon and stock tickers.
3.  **Sentiment Scoring:**
    * **Lexicon-based:** Initial scoring using financial sentiment lexicons (e.g., Loughran-McDonald, VADER adapted for finance).
    * **Machine Learning Models:** Training/fine-tuning transformer models (like FinBERT) on a labeled dataset of financial text for nuanced sentiment classification (e.g., very positive, positive, neutral, negative, very negative).
    * **Aspect-Based Analysis:** Identifying entities (companies, products, economic indicators) and the sentiment expressed towards them within the same text.
4.  **Aggregation & Trend Analysis:** Sentiment scores are aggregated over time and across sources to identify trends, spikes, and divergences.
5.  **Validation (Ongoing):** Comparing sentiment indicators against historical market movements to refine models and assess predictive power.
